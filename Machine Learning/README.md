# Machine Learning

The model we use for machine learning is MobileNetV2 feature extractor from tensorflow, which is a pre-trained model that can be used for easier model creation by leveraging existing layers to enhance performance. The class we trained is in below :
- 0: daun kelor
- 1: daun sirih
- 2: jahe
- 3: lidah buaya
